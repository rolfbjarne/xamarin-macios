    <summary>Base class for timed video and audio.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>An <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVAsset" /> represents one or more media assets. These are held in its <see cref="P:AVFoundation.AVAsset.Tracks" /> property. Additionally, <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVAsset" />s include metadata, track grouping, and preferences about the media.</para>
      <para>Because media assets such as movies are large, instantiating an <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVAsset" /> will not automatically load the file. Properties are loaded when they are queried or via explicit calls to <see cref="M:AVFoundation.AVAsset.LoadValuesTaskAsync(System.String[])" /> or <see cref="M:AVFoundation.AVAsset.LoadValuesAsynchronously(System.String[],System.Action)" />.</para>
      <para>During playback, the current presentation state of an <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVAsset" /> is represented by an <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVPlayerItem" /> object, and the playback is controlled by a <see cref="T:AVFoundation.AVPlayer" />:</para>
