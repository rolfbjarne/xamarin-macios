## fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break


# Used to remove hard to kill delegate API until .NET

# Fixed in .NET

# The parent enum GKVoiceChatService is not available in macOS 
# so to be honest it does not make much sense to expose this constant on macOS
# nor the below protocols

# This selector does not exist in macOS, confirmed by intro.

# API removed by Apple, marked as deprecated
!unknown-native-enum! GKAuthenticationType bound

# Deprecated
!missing-protocol-member! GKInviteEventListener::player:didRequestMatchWithPlayers: not found

# We have bound GKVoiceChatServiceError as GKVoiceChatServiceError which has no support for macOS
!missing-field! GKVoiceChatServiceErrorDomain not bound
# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechatserviceerror?language=objc

# addressed in XAMCORE_5_0
!incorrect-protocol-member! GKTurnBasedEventHandlerDelegate::handleTurnEventForMatch:didBecomeActive: is REQUIRED and should be abstract

# This selector does not exist (respond?) in macOS either
!missing-selector! GKLeaderboardSet::loadImageWithCompletionHandler: not bound

# is marked as Obsolete
!extra-protocol-member! unexpected selector GKMatchDelegate::xamarin:selector:removed: found

!incorrect-protocol-member! GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate::matchmakerViewController:didFindHostedPlayers: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate::matchmakerViewController:didFindMatch: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate::matchmakerViewController:didFindPlayers: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate::turnBasedMatchmakerViewController:didFindMatch: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate::turnBasedMatchmakerViewController:playerQuitForMatch: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract

# NullAllowed makes sense
!extra-null-allowed! 'System.Void GameKit.GKMatchmaker::FindMatchedPlayers(GameKit.GKMatchRequest,System.Action`2<GameKit.GKMatchedPlayers,Foundation.NSError>)' has a extraneous [NullAllowed] on parameter #1
