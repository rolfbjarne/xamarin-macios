# There are issues with the Generic Types listed here: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/15725

# After GCPhysicalInputElementCollection is fixed, we can uncomment the below
# !missing-protocol-conformance! GCPhysicalInputElementCollection should conform to NSFastEnumeration

# Ignore these protocols since they are marked with 'objc_non_runtime_protocol'
# and are being used as NSStrings
