    <summary>A class that can be affected by <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDynamicBehavior" />s.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	Describes the elements that can be affected by the animator.
	Classes that implement the methods of this interface can be
	controlled by the <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDynamicAnimator" />.

	iOS 7 introduced UI Dynamics, which provides physics-based
	animation for UI elements. The overall coordination of UI
	Dynamics is performed by a <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDynamicAnimator" />, which holds
	references to a number of <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDynamicBehavior" />s, which define
	behaviors such as gravity, pushing, and collision
	detection. Each <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDynamicBehavior" /> holds references
	to some amount of <see cref="T:UIKit.IUIDynamicItem" />s, which represent the objects to which the physics model is
	applied.

      <para> 
	While this class contains the full protocol definition,
	and allows for users to override the methods manually in
	subclasses, if you want to create your own items that can be
	animated by the physics engine, all you have to do is
	implement the <see cref="T:UIKit.IUIDynamicItem" />
	interface in your object.  
      </para>
      <para> 
	Two classes that implement <see cref="T:UIKit.IUIDynamicItem" /> are <see cref="T:UIKit.UIView" /> and <see cref="T:UIKit.UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes" />.
