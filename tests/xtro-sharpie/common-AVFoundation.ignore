## there's a type of the same name (like NSObject, check what Swift did)

## fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break

## Used only once in a deprecated API, native use `NSInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`

## native use `NSUInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`
!unknown-native-enum! AVAudioSessionInterruptionFlags bound

## it's already defined in the base class, it's fine even if it returns mutable tracks in this case 

## type and protocol are named identically (check the swift name, it's a similar situation to NSObject)

## AVAudioPlayer INTERRUPTION NOTIFICATIONS ARE DEPRECATED - Use AVAudioSession instead.

# cannot be done because it will break the API, we have a #if define with the correct implementation

!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! CoreMedia.CMFormatDescription AVFoundation.AVTimedMetadataGroup::CopyFormatDescription()'s selector's ('copyFormatDescription') Objective-C method family ('copy') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.

# Initial result from new rule missing-null-allowed

# intro says that this is not true

# no tests/samples

# adding abstract member to an existing type would be a breaking change

# added for .NET since it is part of a new breaking change in a notification
