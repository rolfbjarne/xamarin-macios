			Some feeds have testing versions of the Messaging and HotRestart
			packages with versions 99.*. This means that we'll want the exact
			version of the packages below, not the specified version or any
			other later version, because if the requested version doesn't
			exist, we'll get the testing version and things break in
			interesting ways. So in order to get the exact version, they're
			enclosed in brackets.
