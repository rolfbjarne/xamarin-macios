# Build Properties

MSBuild properties control the behavior of the
[targets](build-targets.md).
They're specified within the project file, for example **MyApp.csproj**, within
an MSBuild PropertyGroup.

## MaciOSPrepareForBuildDependsOn

A semi-colon delimited property that can be used to extend the build process.
MSBuild targets added to this property will execute early in the build for both
application and library project types. This property is empty by default.

Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <MaciOSPrepareForBuildDependsOn>MyCustomTarget</MaciOSPrepareForBuildDependsOn>
</PropertyGroup>

<Target Name="MyCustomTarget" >
  <Message Text="Running target: 'MyCustomTarget'" Importance="high"  />
</Target>
```

This property was introduced in .NET 9.

## MobileAggressiveAttributeTrimming

This property determines whether numerous attributes that are very rarely
needed at runtime should be trimmed away.

This is enabled by default.
