# note: framework not available on watchOS

## we do not expose internal framework versions

## called indirectly (there's a required native layer for them)

## Custom enums to represent header constats like
## static const NSUInteger VNCoreMLRequestRevision1 = 1;

## VNRequest is an abstract class so this will be bound in subclasses
## matching the return type to the above defined custom enums 
## init is available but it's abstract (type) and not a designated initializer (so we don't bind it)

# Not really needed anymore, this old(?) unbound APIs got replaced

# API introduced and deprecated at the same time in Xcode 12

# Existing enums with name changes relevant only to Swift
