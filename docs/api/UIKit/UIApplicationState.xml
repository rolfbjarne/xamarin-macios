    <summary>An enumeration indicating the current application state.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para> 
	When the user taps on the app icon, the app briefly
	goes through a transitional state of
	UIApplicationState.Inactive on its way to becoming
	UIApplicationState.Active. This is where the app gets
	itself ready to display to the user.
      </para>
      <para>
	When the app is open, the application state is UIApplicationState.Active.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the user presses the home button, and is returned to
	the springboard (home screen), or the application is
	interrupted by something, such as a phone call, the
	application state transitions back to
	UIApplicationState.Inactive.
      </para>
      <para> 
	For the application state of your app to become
	UIApplicationState.Background, your application would have
	to register for a background process.
