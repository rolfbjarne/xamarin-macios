				1. This directory will be cleared before signing (the _PrepareHotRestartAppBundle target);
				   anything in this directory before this point will be deleted.
				2. After signing, it shouldn't change (because that would invalidate the signature).

			HotRestartContentDir and HotRestartAppContentDir:

			These two are virtually the same but used for different purposes.
			The Content dir contains the files that don't need to be shipped
			in the root of the app bundle, and don't need to be signed. This
			files can then be pushed to the app individually without needing
			to redeploy the app, making things much faster. This usually
			contains assemblies, like the app project one.
			HotRestartAppContentDir is the location of the Content dir inside
			the signed app bundle (in case we need to re-deploy the whole
			app). HotRestartContentDir has the same content with some stamp
			files to detect which file can be incrementally pushed to the app
			(in case we don't need to re-deploy the app)
