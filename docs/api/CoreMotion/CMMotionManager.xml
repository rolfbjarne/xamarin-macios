    <summary>Core class that provides access to the motion services in iOS.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Core Motion was introduced in iOS 7 and is not available on all devices (the iPhone 5S was the first phone to have the necessary coprocessor and the iPad Air 2 was the first tablet). Developers can check if Core Motion is available with <see cref="P:CoreMotion.CMMotionManager.DeviceMotionAvailable" />.</para>
      <para>Applications that wish to access Core Motion must have an <c>entitlements.plist</c> file.</para>
      <para>Users must explicitly grant access to Core Motion via a standard privacy dialog. Unlike most functions that require user permissions, there is not a corresponding API to check status. However, applications can perform a query and, if authorization is not available, will receive an error of type <see cref="F:CoreMotion.CMError.MotionActivityNotAuthorized" />. This technique is shown in the following example:</para>
      <example>
        <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
var stepCounter = new CMStepCounter ();
stepCounter.QueryStepCount(
	NSDate.FromTimeIntervalSinceNow(-60 * 60 * 24),
	NSDate.Now,
	NSOperationQueue.MainQueue, ((steps, error) => {
		if(error != null && error.Code == (int) CMError.MotionActivityNotAuthorized)
		{
			motionStatus = "Not Authorized";
			UpdateStatus();
		}
		else
		{
			motionStatus = "Available";
			var stepMsg = String.Format("You have taken {0} steps in the past 24 hours", steps);
			InvokeOnMainThread(() => {
				stepsMessage.Text = stepMsg;
				UpdateStatus();
			});
		}
	}));
