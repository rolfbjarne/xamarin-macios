## Native code has NWPathStatus in NetworkExtension and nw_path_status_t in Network (with the same elements).
## NetworkExtension.NWPathStatus is the oldest, but NetworkExtension isn't present on all the platforms Network
## is, which means we can't use the same managed enum for both cases (the native enums aren't entirely identical
## either: one is pointer sized while the other is 32-bit always).
!duplicate-type-name! NWPathStatus enum exists as both NetworkExtension.NWPathStatus and Network.NWPathStatus
!missing-release-attribute-on-return-value! NetworkExtension.NEAppRule[] NetworkExtension.NETunnelProviderManager::CopyAppRules()'s selector's ('copyAppRules') Objective-C method family ('copy') indicates that the native method returns a retained object, and as such a '[return: Release]' attribute is required.
