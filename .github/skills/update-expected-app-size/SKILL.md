  Download updated expected app size files from Azure DevOps CI artifacts for

# Update Expected App Size Files

Download updated expected app size files from Azure DevOps artifacts for the current branch's PR build, and apply them to the repository.

## When to Use

- App size tests failed in CI and the user wants to update the expected files
- User asks to "update app size", "download expected files", or "fix app size test failures"
- User wants to pull the updated expected files from a recent CI build

## Background

The app size tests (`tests/dotnet/UnitTests/AppSizeTest.cs`) compare the built app's size and preserved APIs against expected files stored in `tests/dotnet/UnitTests/expected/`. When the test detects a difference and `WRITE_KNOWN_FAILURES` is not set, it writes the updated expected file to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/updated-expected-sizes/`, and a pipeline step publishes this directory as a build artifact.

The artifact name follows the pattern `{uploadPrefix}updated-expected-sizes-{testPrefix}-{attempt}` (e.g., `updated-expected-sizes-dotnettests_ios-1`). Because the expected files can be very big, the test uploads a unified **diff** for each changed expected file rather than the whole file. Inside the artifact, files are named after the test variant with a `.diff` suffix:
- `{Platform}-{Variant}-size.txt.diff` — e.g., `iOS-MonoVM-size.txt.diff`, `iOS-MonoVM-interpreter-size.txt.diff`, `iOS-NativeAOT-TrimmableStatic-size.txt.diff`, `MacOSX-CoreCLR-Interpreter-size.txt.diff`
- `{Platform}-{Variant}-preservedapis.txt.diff` — e.g., `iOS-MonoVM-preservedapis.txt.diff`, `MacCatalyst-MonoVM-interpreter-preservedapis.txt.diff`

Each diff is a unified diff (relative to the repository root) that can be applied with `git apply -p1` or `patch -p1`. The expected files on disk are at:
- `tests/dotnet/UnitTests/expected/{Platform}-{Variant}-size.txt`
- `tests/dotnet/UnitTests/expected/{Platform}-{Variant}-preservedapis.txt`

## Workflow

### 1. Determine the current branch and PR

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# Find the PR number for this branch
gh pr list --head "$BRANCH" --repo dotnet/macios --json number,url --jq '.[0]'
```

If no PR is found, inform the user that this skill requires a PR to exist for the current branch (so that CI has run).

### 2. Find the Azure DevOps build

The CI builds for PRs in dotnet/macios run in the `devdiv` Azure DevOps organization, project `DevDiv`.

Use the GitHub PR checks to find the Azure DevOps build URL:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --repo dotnet/macios
```

Look for a check that links to Azure DevOps. The build URL will look like:
```
https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=XXXXXXX
```

Extract the `buildId` from the URL.

### 3. Download the artifacts

Use the Azure DevOps REST API to list and download artifacts:

```bash
# List artifacts for the build
TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --resource 499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798 --query accessToken -o tsv)
curl -s "https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apis/build/builds/{buildId}/artifacts?api-version=7.0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Look for artifacts whose names contain `updated-expected-sizes` (e.g., `updated-expected-sizes-dotnettests_ios-1`). Get the artifact's `downloadUrl` and download it:

```bash
# Get the download URL for a specific artifact
ARTIFACT_INFO=$(curl -s "https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apis/build/builds/{buildId}/artifacts?artifactName={artifactName}&api-version=7.0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")
DOWNLOAD_URL=$(echo "$ARTIFACT_INFO" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['resource']['downloadUrl'])")

# Download the artifact zip
curl -sL "$DOWNLOAD_URL" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -o artifact.zip
```

If `az` is not available or not authenticated, direct the user to download manually from the Azure DevOps build artifacts page.

### 4. Place the files

Extract the downloaded artifact zip and apply each diff to the expected directory from the repository root:

```bash
unzip -o artifact.zip -d /tmp/updated-sizes/
# Each '*.txt.diff' is a unified diff relative to the repository root.
for diff in /tmp/updated-sizes/*/*.txt.diff; do
  git apply -p1 "$diff"
done
```

The diffs reference `tests/dotnet/UnitTests/expected/<name>.txt` directly, so applying them updates (or creates) the expected files in place. If a diff fails to apply cleanly (e.g., the expected file changed since the CI build), re-run the failing app size test locally with `WRITE_KNOWN_FAILURES=1` to regenerate the file (see the "Run Locally" fallback).

### 5. Verify and commit

After placing the files:
1. Run `git diff` to show what changed
2. Ask the user if the changes look correct
3. If confirmed, commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add tests/dotnet/UnitTests/expected/
   git commit -m "[tests] Update expected app size files"
   ```

## Fallback: Manual Download

If automated download fails (auth issues, etc.), provide the user with:
1. The Azure DevOps build URL
2. Instructions to navigate to the build → Summary → Artifacts section
3. Look for individual artifacts whose names contain `updated-expected-sizes`
4. Download the artifact zip, extract it, and apply the `.txt.diff` files (e.g., `iOS-MonoVM-interpreter-size.txt.diff`) from the repository root with `git apply -p1 <file>`

## Fallback: Run Locally

If the user can build locally, they can update the expected files directly:

```bash
WRITE_KNOWN_FAILURES=1 tests-dotnet AppSizeTest
```

This runs the tests, updates the expected files in place, and marks the tests as passed.
