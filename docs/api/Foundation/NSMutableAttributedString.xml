    <summary>Mutable strings that can be annotated with a set of attributes.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	The NSMutableAttributedString holds a mutable string that can
	has a series of overlapping attributes applied to ranges of
	the string.

      </para>
      <para>
	Unlike the <see cref="T:Foundation.NSAttributedString" /> both the
	contents of the string as well as the attributes applied to it
	can be changed after the string has been constructed.

      </para>
      <para> 
	These types typically are used to attach information to
	elements of the string that dictate the font and colors to use
	as well as rendering attributes like kerning or how to render
	ligatures on a specific run of code.
      </para>
      <para> These classes do not dictate the meaning or behavior of
	the attributes on a string, they merely keep track of the
	attributes.  The actual meaning of these attributes is
	interpreted by the consumer of these objects.   
      </para>
      <para> If you are performing multiple changes to an
	NSMutableAttributedString, you can optimize the performance by
	surrounding your changes with calls to <format type="text/html"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/index?search=Foundation%20Begin%20Editing(%20)&amp;scope=Xamarin" title="M:Foundation.BeginEditing()">M:Foundation.BeginEditing()</a></format> and <format type="text/html"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/index?search=Foundation%20End%20Editing(%20)&amp;scope=Xamarin" title="M:Foundation.EndEditing()">M:Foundation.EndEditing()</a></format>.  This will
	prevent the internal data structures to be updated on every
	change and delay the internal changes until the <format type="text/html"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/index?search=Foundation%20End%20Editing(%20)&amp;scope=Xamarin" title="M:Foundation.EndEditing()">M:Foundation.EndEditing()</a></format> method is called.
