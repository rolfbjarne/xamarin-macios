Microsoft.Sdk.Eol.targets

Imported only when using a .NET version that has reached EOL, contains settings to force the error:

error NETSDK1202: The workload 'ios' is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future. Please refer to https://aka.ms/maui-support-policy for more information about the support policy.

Things to note:

* $(WarningsAsErrors) includes NETSDK1202, so that the build stops and we don't run into other (and more confusing) errors.
* Force $(TargetPlatformVersion) to just be 1.0, to make it past early error messages
* _ClearMissingWorkloads prevents undesired extra error messages
