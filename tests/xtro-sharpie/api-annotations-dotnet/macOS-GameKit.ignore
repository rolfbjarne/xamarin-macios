# The parent enum GKVoiceChatService is not available in macOS 
# so to be honest it does not make much sense to expose this constant on macOS
# nor the below protocols

# This selector does not exist in macOS, confirmed by intro.

# Deprecated
!missing-protocol-member! GKInviteEventListener::player:didRequestMatchWithPlayers: not found
!missing-protocol-member! GKTurnBasedEventListener::player:didRequestMatchWithPlayers: not found

# We have bound GKVoiceChatServiceError as GKVoiceChatServiceError which has no support for macOS
!missing-field! GKVoiceChatServiceErrorDomain not bound
# https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkvoicechatserviceerror?language=objc

# This selector does not exist (respond?) in macOS either
!missing-selector! GKLeaderboardSet::loadImageWithCompletionHandler: not bound

# NullAllowed makes sense
!extra-null-allowed! 'System.Void GameKit.GKMatchmaker::FindMatchedPlayers(GameKit.GKMatchRequest,System.Action`2<GameKit.GKMatchedPlayers,Foundation.NSError>)' has a extraneous [NullAllowed] on parameter #1
