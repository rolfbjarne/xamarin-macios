## all members are marked as not available on watchOS (but not the protocol itself)

# as per the header comments, the following two enums have to be ignored on watchOS

# got removed in watchOS 5 withouth a deprecation, added obsolete attr.

!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitManufacturerNameApple bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeEffect bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeFormatConverter bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeGenerator bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeMIDIProcessor bound

!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeMusicDevice bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeMusicEffect bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeOfflineEffect bound
!unknown-field! AVAudioUnitTypeOutput bound

# headers say it is present, but AVMetadataItemFilter is not

# The related keys are inside AVVideo which is not available in watchOS

# members of that category are not annotated as supporting watchOS
!unknown-native-enum! AVAudioSessionFlags bound

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/16229 prevents crashing instead of return null
## so these selectors have been bound manually
