    <summary>Abstract base class providing local and cloud-based management of Model data.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>Application developers can subclass <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDocument" /> to create objects that are "Model-Controllers" and relate to Model (domain) objects analogously to how <see cref="T:UIKit.UIViewController" /> relate to <see cref="T:UIKit.UIView" />s. iOS provides a number of functions, including background asynchronous reading and writing of application data, automatic and safe data-saving, storage that is automatically coordinated between the application sandbox and cloud services, etc.</para>
      <block subset="none" type="inheritors">
        <para>At a minimum, application developers need to implement <see cref="M:UIKit.UIDocument.ContentsForType(System.String,Foundation.NSError@)" /> (for storage) and <see cref="M:UIKit.UIDocument.LoadFromContents(Foundation.NSObject,System.String,Foundation.NSError@)" /> (for retrieval). Additionally, application developers need to manage the lifecyle of the <see cref="T:UIKit.UIDocument" /> and this requires the application developer to set the preferred storage location, create a file URL, and discover, open, and close the file. Application developers should also track changes and resolve conflicts between document versions.</para>
